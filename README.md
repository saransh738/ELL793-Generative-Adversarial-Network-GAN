# Style Generative Adversarial Network(Style-GAN)
## Problem Statement:
* Load a pre-trained StyleGAN model and print its architecture. Choose a layer of interest to visualize and print its weights.
* Modify the code to perform style mixing between two randomly generated latent vectors at the chosen layer. Display the resulting images. 
* Choose another layer of interest and visualize its weights. Explain any differences or similarities with the weights of the previous layer. 
* Explain the concept of style mixing in StyleGAN. How does it differ from traditional style transfer methods? How does it affect the generated images? 
* How does the depth of the chosen layer affect the quality of the generated images in style mixing? Why? 
* Modify the code to perform style mixing with more than two latent vectors. Display the resulting images.

# Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)
## Problem Statement:
* Build a GAN from scratch for the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
* Use CNN models for generator and discriminator networks.
* Optimize the learning rate and mention the best learning rate for the model.
* Plot generator results before, during (for few or all epochs), and after training.
